	 		<h1>We are Technovation</h1>
	 		<h2>We're entrepreneurs, mentors, and educators looking to teach girls everywhere the skills they need to change the world with technology.
	 		</h2>
	 		<p>
	 		Technovation offers girls around the world the opportunity to learn the skills they need to emerge as tech entrepreneurs and leaders. Every year we invite girls to identify a problem in their community, and then challenge them to solve it.
	 		</p>
	 		<p>
	 		Girls work in teams to build both a mobile app and a business plan to launch that app, supported by mentors and guided by our curriculum.			
	 		</p>
	 		<p>
	 		Technovation's curriculum takes students through 4 stages of launching a mobile app startup, inspired by the principles of design thinking:
	 			<ul>
	 				<li>Ideation</li>
	 				<li>Technology</li>
	 				<li>Entrepreneurship</li>
	 				<li>Pitch</li>
	 			</ul>
